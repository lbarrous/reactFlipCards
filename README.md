#To launch the app:

#How to use it:

The first screen you will see would be a blank page with a button allowing you to create a new card. Once you click on it 
you will see a modal in which you will trigger a form in which you can fill the data of the card (title and description are
required and the url of the image is optional). Once you fill all the data you will see your card (If you do not provide a
url you will see a defuault image of github logo).

With you cards being displayed you can order them by title or by creation date.
